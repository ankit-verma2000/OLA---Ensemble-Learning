# **OLA - Ensemble Learning Business Case**
❖ Topic: Ensemble Learning in Driver Attrition Prediction
## **📚 About Data?**

> **From the company’s perspective:**
● Ola is a leading ride-sharing platform, aiming to provide reliable, affordable, and convenient urban transportation for everyone.

● The constant challenge Ola faces is the churn rate of its drivers. Ensuring driver loyalty and reducing attrition are crucial to the company's operation.

● Analyzing driver data can reveal patterns in driver behaviour, performance, and satisfaction. This would help in foreseeing potential churn and allow proactive measures.

● By leveraging data science and ensemble learning, Ola can predict driver churn, which would be pivotal in its driver retention strategy.

> **From the learner’s perspective:**
● Engaging with this case offers a practical understanding of how ride-sharing giants operate and the challenges they face.

● Ensemble learning, comprising various algorithms and techniques, can significantly improve prediction accuracy over standalone methods.

● This exercise hones the participant's skills in imputation, dealing with class imbalances, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

● Additionally, learners gain hands-on experience in tackling real-world problems, transforming raw data into actionable insights that can guide business strategies.
